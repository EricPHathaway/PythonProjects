How to get the same look as in my Video:


###    Shader: "SEUS PTGI E6" by Sonic Ether (I changed all settings to the highest, out of the box the shader doesn't look it's best so you need to tweak it a little)  Use the Minecraft and Optfine version + settings that is recommended by Sonic Ether. Otherwise it might not work.

###    Drag the folder "UMSOEA R3 textures" into your ".minecraft"  --> "resourcepacks"  folder. (It's the resourcepack overlay file, you don't need to unzip it)

You are not allowed to share/edit/reupload my textures.

Hope you like it! Have an awesome day!
